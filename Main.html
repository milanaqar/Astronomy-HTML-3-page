            <h3>The Science of the Cosmos</h3>
            <p>Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole. It encompasses the observation and interpretation of everything from planets and moons in our own solar system to distant galaxies billions of light-years away.
                <br><br>Throughout history, humans have looked up at the night sky with wonder and curiosity. Today, with advanced telescopes and space missions, we continue to uncover the mysteries of our cosmos, from black holes and dark matter to the origins of the universe itself.
